<h3> Using numerical root-finding methods, solve one question </h3>
<h4> Question we solved using these methods</h4>

<p><i>Determine the drag coefficient c needed for a parachutist of mass m = 68.1 kg to have a velocity of 40 m/s after free-falling for time t = 10 s. Note: The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2</i></p>

<p>Numerical root-finding or root approximation methods are used to find the roots or solutions of nonlinear equations, where a root is a value of the independent variable that makes the equation equal to zero. Here's a brief description of each:</p>
<ol>
   <li><b> Bisection Method:</b></li>
      <p>The bisection method is a simple numerical technique that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further iteration. It's based on the intermediate value theorem.</p>

   <li><b> False Position Method (Regula Falsi):</b></li>
      <p>The false position method, also known as the regula falsi, is an iterative method that uses linear interpolation to find the root of an equation. It combines aspects of both bisection and linear interpolation.</p>

   <li><b> Newton-Raphson Method:</b></li>
      <p>The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique that uses the first derivative of a function to find successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function. It converges rapidly for well-behaved functions.</p>

   <li><b> Secant Method:</b></li>
      <p>The secant method is another iterative root-finding method that does not require the computation of the derivative. Instead of using the derivative, it approximates the derivative by finite differences. The method is based on the secant line to the curve.</p>
</ol>

<p>These methods are widely used in numerical analysis and computational mathematics to solve equations that may not have analytical solutions or for which finding an analytical solution is impractical. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method often depends on the characteristics of the specific problem at hand.</p>
